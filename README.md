# snowball_list
To-do list to fulfill my personal needs and hopefully yours as well

The name Snowball List is based on the Snowball effect which happens when you keep doing a certain task consistently, so it has some personal development flavor to it.

I'm still designing the User-Experience but here's what I came up with so far:

Main menu:

![to do list open source software_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13939081/27701107-8f25cc26-5d08-11e7-9c87-00609064085d.png)

Add a Task:

![to do list open source software_ 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13939081/27701106-8f2133b4-5d08-11e7-984f-57b6cee64f56.png)

Take a break menu:

![to do list open source software_ 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13939081/27701108-8f2d9e2e-5d08-11e7-8637-027185df771e.png)

Options:

![to do list open source software_ 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13939081/27701105-8f20b4ca-5d08-11e7-8040-715b699a39a2.png)
